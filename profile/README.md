This course expands upon the material from Web 102, and dives deeper into more JavaScript concepts. Students will learn about objects, data, functional programming, asynchronous execution, and more! By the end of the semester, students should be able to create an advanced website that connects to an external API and dynamically updates based on real live information.

## [Software Development Capstone](https://github.com/hytechclub/capstone?tab=readme-ov-file#software-development-capstone)
This course gives students the opportunity to work on one long-term project for the entirety of the semester. There may be some instructor-led lessons scattered throughout the course, but most of the time will be spent working individually or as teams to build software applications. By the end of the semester, each team should have a final project to present.
